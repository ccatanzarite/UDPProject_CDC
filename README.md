Steps to run client and server:
1.) Compile client and server using  javac 
2.) Run server by typing "java UDPserver". It should say "Server is Running" to show that it is running.
3.) To run client you need to type "java UDPclient <ipAddress> <port>". The port number 2030 is hardcoded into the server.
4.) Once client is run, it will ask for a command. You can use <REQUESTQUOTE> to get a quote or <END> to end the client.
